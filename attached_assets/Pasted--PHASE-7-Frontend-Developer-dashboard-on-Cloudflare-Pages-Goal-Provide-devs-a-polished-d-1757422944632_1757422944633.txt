## PHASE 7 — Frontend (Developer dashboard) on Cloudflare Pages

**Goal:** Provide devs a polished dashboard to register, verify, see API key, usage, and test endpoints.

**Pages to build**

- Landing page with CTA + code snippet
- Signup / Verify pages
- Login & Session management
- Dashboard:
    - Show API key (masked) with Show/Hide and Revoke & Regenerate (calls backend)
    - Quota progress bar + numeric count
    - Usage chart (last 7 days)
    - API Playground to test `/movies` and `/search`

**Tasks**

1. Implement pages and client-side calls to Worker endpoints.
2. Use JWT in HttpOnly cookie for session.
3. Connect to Brevo flows for signup/verify.
4. Display errors from API clearly.

**Expected outcome**

- A developer can fully sign up, verify via OTP, see API key, and call playground endpoints using their key.

**How to test / Acceptance**

- Complete signup → verify OTP → dashboard shows key.
- Dashboard playground requests succeed using the user’s key.
- Revoke/regenerate invalidates old key and issues new one.

**Estimated time:** 8–16 days (UI design + auth flows + polishing)

**Pitfalls**

- CORS must be configured to allow Pages domain to Workers.
- Sessions storage/cookies must be secure and same-site settings configured.

## PHASE 8 — Admin UI (Cloudflare Pages)

**Goal:** Friendly admin portal for CSV uploads, key management, logs and CORS whitelist.

**Pages to build**

- Admin login
- Admin dashboard (KPIs: total users, active keys, calls today)
- CSV import UI (file -> dry-run preview -> import)
- API keys manager (search, suspend, reset quota)
- Usage logs viewer with filters

**Tasks**

1. Implement admin UI components and wire them to admin JSON endpoints.
2. Add role-based access control in frontend and backend (only admin users can access pages).
3. Add CORS whitelist UI (update KV or DB entry applied by Worker middleware).

**Expected outcome**

- Admin can perform all management tasks through UI without CLI.

**How to test / Acceptance**

- Admin uploads CSV via UI; users see new movies immediately.
- Admin suspends key; requests with suspended key return 401.

**Estimated time:** 6–12 days

**Pitfalls**

- Ensure admin portals are not indexed or discoverable publicly.
