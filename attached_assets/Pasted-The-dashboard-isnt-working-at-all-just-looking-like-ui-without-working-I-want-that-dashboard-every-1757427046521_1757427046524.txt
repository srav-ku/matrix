The dashboard isnt working at all, just looking like ui without working

I want that dashboard every feature working real time
The data monitoring (total requests etc are not real time just random values, and rate limit is 100/day)

And the endpoints should work only on api keys (which users get when sign in sucessful with verfication, and they can use those endpoints for accessing movies data

And all those features are not working just clickable without anything working

and the graph its not at all realtime working

Make it fully Working API offering website (all from the dashboard) showing its endpoints too to access and use them)

And after fully build then give me testing how the endpoints are working with api key and without any api

test yourself every single possibility and then tell how its working perfect or not then i will test them from my side as user too

Also add account deletion permanantly option

Add good favicon that related to The Matrix (film related unique)

Everything shouldwork as realtime API website fully working
